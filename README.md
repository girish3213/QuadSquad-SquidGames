<h1> Slot Finder </h1>

<body>
  <ul>
    <li>We used the python libraries to find the common slots in the VIT timetable.</li>
    <li>We used node, mongoDB and multer for the web backend operations.  </li>
    <li>For frontend, we used HTML, CSS, bootstrap, JS. </li>
  </ul>
  </body>
  
  
<b> A one-dimensional JSON array containing all slots' info for all days of the week, one after the other. For each day, there are 13 values, as there are 13 time slots everyday (TH + LAB)
1 = Filled slot
0 = Empty slot

The first 13 values of the JSON array are the time slot values for Monday, the next 13 for Tuesday, and so on. </b>

To load the server:
